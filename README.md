**lolPy was originally made to be more OOP friendly. I treated it like my C# equivalent, and that was both fun and a learning experience. However, that was not very Pythonic, and I've since created a new API client for my own personal project. I've decided to branch the old version (v1.0) which had the dependency on restPy and update this project with the new, more general purpose client.**

To use lolPy, you must first create an instance of `riot_client.Client`, which requires an API key from [RiotGames](https://developer.riotgames.com/). 

lolPy 2.0 is written with Python 3.5 and requires [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/). I've commented out some of the code that is used by my project to demonstrate how I've decided to handle errors from Riot's API.

lolPy 1.0 still exists as a branch for those who'd like to use it. It is no longer supported by me though.

**The wiki is still WIP for this new version.**
